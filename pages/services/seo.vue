          <ul class="ps-5 mt-2 space-y-1 list-decimal list-inside">
            <li>SEO is simultaneously one of the simplest and also one of the most misunderstood aspects of the web.</li>
            <li>Improving search engine placement requires performance and technical improvement in most cases, but this is not the whole story.</li>
            <li>
              Staying relevant from an SEO standpoint requires ongoing monitoring and maintance to keep up with the latest trends and changes in your industry.
